Here is a repository showing some of my experience in programming and data science. Below is a description of the files:

## creditcard_fraud.py 

In this script the objective was to create a supervised clissification model to classify fraudulent transactions. The dataset used in this script is highly imbalanced and therefore different sampling techniques were used to see see if it could increase the model's performance. Different classification models were  trained on a trainingset and then tested on a validationset where the metric aurpc (average-precision_score) was used to find the "best" classifier. Finally, the classifier was used on a test-set to find the optimal threshold to maximize profit. 


## AIS_PROJECT.ipynb

In this project I was provided with a dataset consisting of 1.4 million AIS-satellite positions from Bulk Carriers. The objective in this project was to identify the ships travel routes, and to see if it was possible to create a machine learning model to predict time to arrival for ships having Singapore as its destination. This project was a great learning experience for understanding how to work with coordinate-positions and its potential, and it increased my skills in manipulating data using the Pandas library. The sctript is a bit messy and lack some explanation of what the codes do but I hope it can showcase some of my skills.
